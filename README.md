# About this Repo

A fork of the official Docker image for
[swarm](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/swarm/) that uses `alpine:edge`
as a base image instead of `scratch`. See the
Hub page for the full readme on how to use the Docker image and for information
regarding contributing and issues.

The full readme is generated over in [docker-library/docs](https://github.com/docker-library/docs),
specificially in [docker-library/docs/swarm](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/swarm).
